            <h3>Childhood Education</h3>

            <p>
                After leaving Vietnam at the age of two, he grew up in a working-class family marked by the experiences
                of war and exile. His mother, an illiterate seamstress, and his grandmother, a former rice farmer,
                profoundly shaped his imagination and relationship with language. Vuong was the first in his family to
                learn how to read and write.
            </p>
            <p>
                He studied initially at the University of Hartford, later earning a B.A. in English from Brooklyn
                College, followed by an M.F.A. in creative writing at New York University.
            </p>

            <h3>Early Writing Years</h3>
            <p>
                His first poems appeared in small literary journals, but it was with the collection <em>Night Sky with
                    Exit Wounds</em> (2016) that he gained international recognition. His poetry explores themes of the
                Vietnam War’s legacy, migration, queer identity, and the fragility of language.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, he published his debut novel, <em>On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous</em>, widely acclaimed by
                critics.
                Written as a letter to his illiterate mother, the book intertwines autobiography, family history, and
                reflections on sexuality, race, and inherited trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2022, he released <em>Time Is a Mother</em>, a poetry collection shaped by mourning his mother’s
                death and an
                even more intimate exploration of grief and survival.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ocean Vuong currently teaches literature and creative writing at the University of Massachusetts
                Amherst.
